Prediction of five-year mortality after COPD diagnosis: development and validation of prognosis model using primary care records

prepare_data.R is the main file, calling others when needed. datasets are really big, and while i've made the code as stable as possible it can crash, especially if RAM is limited. If it crashes load saved files and contain from where the last saved file was created. If in doubt ask for help: steven.kiddle@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk
